# Demos that exercise the CNC Shield v3.xx directly (no GRBL layer or such)

Be SURE to set the proper reference voltage using the trimpots on the driver board (A4988, DRV8825, etc.) BEFORE connecting steppers!

I tested using a Mega 2560 + CNC Shield v3.00 + Kysan 1124090 steppers + DRV8825 drivers (Vref set to 0.6V) + 12VDC to the CNC board
